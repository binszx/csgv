Initial wireframes focused on a two-column layoutâ€”feature text on one side, relevant imagery on the other, maintaining high visual clarity.

Logo:
A minimalist AI-themed logo was designed to symbolize innovation and technology with a sleek, modern feel (uploaded logo image).

Color Scheme:

Background: Dark tech-patterned background for a futuristic vibe.

Primary Accent: Soft brown tones for cards and navigation to balance the dark theme.

Font: Rounded, friendly typeface that remains easy to read while giving the design a slightly playful, futuristic touch.

 Bootstrap SCSS Customizations
This project uses Bootstrap but with the following custom SCSS overrides:

Primary Colors: Custom brown and dark backgrounds.

Button Styles: Rounded corners with muted hover effects.

Typography: Custom Google Fonts integration (for a softer, tech-appropriate look).

Cards and Sections: Increased padding, larger border-radius, and soft box shadows for a modern card effect.

All Bootstrap default variables were overridden in a separate SCSS file to maintain consistency across components.
