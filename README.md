## Bootstrap SCSS Customizations
### Typography

- Bootstrap's default font-family has been overridden with "Poppins", sans-serif.

### Theme Customization
Bootstrap's theme colors have been customized to align with the project's branding.

- The .btn-pulse class adds an animated pulse effect to buttons to draw attention.
- Sections such as .team-section, .impact-section, and .hero have been styled for better visual appeal and responsiveness.
