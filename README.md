## Bootstrap SCSS Customizations
### Typography
The typography uses the "Poppins" font for a modern, clean, and professional look. Headings are bold and rounded, making them eye-catching yet friendly, while body text maintains a medium weight for easy readability. The text contrasts well against the muted dark background, creating a clear and inviting design that suits tech and productivity-focused services.

**Theme Customization**  
The theme of the website has been customized to deliver a modern, clean, and responsive design. The default Bootstrap styling has been overridden to feature the "Poppins" font family for a sleek and professional look. Custom color schemes were applied, using a deep navy blue and vibrant green palette to create a strong contrast and build trust.  
Button elements are enhanced with a pulse animation (`.btn-pulse`) to draw user attention to key actions. Sections such as the Hero, Team, Impact, and About areas have been specifically styled for improved visual hierarchy and responsiveness across devices.  
Additional adjustments include custom padding, margin tweaks, and hover effects on cards and buttons to create a more interactive and polished user experience. The overall theme prioritizes readability, accessibility, and modern UI/UX best practices.

Would you also like a **shorter** or **more casual** version depending on where you plan to use this (like for a project report, website documentation, or a pitch)? ðŸš€
