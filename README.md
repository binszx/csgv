Initial wireframes focused on a two-column layoutâ€”feature text on one side, relevant imagery on the other, maintaining high visual clarity.

Logo:
A minimalist AI-themed logo was designed to symbolize innovation and technology with a sleek, modern feel (uploaded logo image).

Color Scheme:

The website uses a modern, minimal color palette. The primary background is white, ensuring readability. Accent colors include vibrant shades of *blue and purple* for buttons and highlights, giving a tech-oriented feel. Text is mostly in *black or dark gray*, maintaining contrast. Testimonials and service cards use *light gray* backgrounds to subtly separate content. Overall, the color scheme is clean, professional, and tech-friendly.
