Design choices

wireframe
The website follows a clean, three-page wireframe. 
It starts with a hero section introducing "Tech Boost" 
and its AI tools. Below that, it showcases three core 
services (AI Scheduler, Smart Notes, AutoTask Manager), 
followed by a testimonials section featuring four users. 
At the bottom, it provides contact info, location, and 
social media links. The layout is minimal and scroll-based, 
with navigation links anchoring to each  section.

logo
The logo features a bold, modern design 
representing "AI Support." It uses a 
stylized black "A" formed by geometric
lines, with a red block above it suggesting the
dot of a lowercase "i," completing the "AI" initials. 
The clean typography and dark background give it a sleek, 
tech-forward feel, reflecting innovation and digital support.

color
The website uses a modern, minimal color 
palette. The primary background is white, 
ensuring readability. Accent colors include
vibrant shades of  blue and purple for buttons
and highlights, giving a tech-oriented feel. 
Text is mostly in  black or dark gray, maintaining
contrast. Testimonials and service cards use light gray
backgrounds to subtly separate content. Overall, the color
scheme is clean, professional, and tech-friendly.
